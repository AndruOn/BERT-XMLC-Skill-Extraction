The centrepiece of this new way of learning is The Hive, a groundbreaking learning facility that has been described by CNN as having redefined the traditional classroom.\\u00a0\\nInnovative education initiatives also include signature programmes such as Renaissance Engineering Programme, CN Yang Scholars Programme, NTU-University Scholars Programme. Designed for high-achieving students, these programmes offer a multidisciplinary curriculum, guidance by top faculty, interdisciplinary and intensive research opportunities, overseas exposure, as well as dialogues with world-class scientists and industry leaders.?\\nSet up jointly with Imperial College London, NTU's medical school, is grooming a new generation of doctors to meet the healthcare needs of Singapore.\\nResearch impact\\nKnown for research excellence and technological innovation, NTU leads the top Asian universities in normalised research citation impact (Clarivate Analytics\\u2019 InCites 2016). In the 2018\\u00a0Nature Index, NTU is placed 29th among the world's universities and first in Singapore.\\nNTU's five-year strategic plan, NTU 2020, builds on strong foundations of NTU 2015 and aims to propel NTU to greater heights of research excellence. The plan focuses on five key research thrusts \\u2013 Sustainable Earth, Global Asia, Secure Community, Healthy Society and Future Learning. The areas leverage NTU\\u2019s diverse strengths, particularly its longstanding expertise in engineering, business and education, and the interfaces these have with various disciplines such as in healthcare, science and the humanities. NTU\\u2019s sustainability initiatives have clinched significant competitive research funding and the university is already a global leader in this area.\\n\"\n",
