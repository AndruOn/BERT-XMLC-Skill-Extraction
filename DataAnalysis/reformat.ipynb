      "Innovative education initiatives also include signature programmes such as Renaissance Engineering Programme, CN Yang Scholars Programme, NTU-University Scholars Programme. Designed for high-achieving students, these programmes offer a multidisciplinary curriculum, guidance by top faculty, interdisciplinary and intensive research opportunities, overseas exposure, as well as dialogues with world-class scientists and industry leaders.?\n",
      "Set up jointly with Imperial College London, NTU's medical school, is grooming a new generation of doctors to meet the healthcare needs of Singapore.\n",
      "Research impact\n",
      "Known for research excellence and technological innovation, NTU leads the top Asian universities in normalised research citation impact (Clarivate Analyticsâ€™ InCites 2016). In the 2018Â Nature Index, NTU is placed 29th among the world's universities and first in Singapore.\n",
      "NTU's five-year strategic plan, NTU 2020, builds on strong foundations of NTU 2015 and aims to propel NTU to greater heights of research excellence. The plan focuses on five key research thrusts â€“ Sustainable Earth, Global Asia, Secure Community, Healthy Society and Future Learning. The areas leverage NTUâ€™s diverse strengths, particularly its longstanding expertise in engineering, business and education, and the interfaces these have with various disciplines such as in healthcare, science and the humanities. NTUâ€™s sustainability initiatives have clinched significant competitive research funding and the university is already a global leader in this area.\n",

      " Database Administrator <span class=\"hl\">Database</span> <span class=\"hl\">Administrator</span> Database Administrator - Family Private Care LLC Lawrenceville, GA A self-motivated Production SQL Server Database Administrator who possessesÂ  strong analytical and problem solving skills. My experience includes SQL ServerÂ  2005, 2008 and 2012, 2014, SSIS, as well as clustering, mirroring, and highÂ  availability solutions in OLTP environments. I am proficient in database backup,Â  recovery, performance tuning, maintenance tasks, security, and consolidation.Â  I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company. Over theÂ  course of my career thus far, I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs,Â  successfully ensured the security of those databases, problem-solved in order to meetÂ  both back-end and front-end needs, installed and tested new versions databaseÂ  management systems, customized and installed applications and meticulouslyÂ  monitored performance for the smoothest front-end experience possible. During myÂ  5 to 6 years working with databases. Work Experience Database Administrator Family Private Care LLC - Roswell, GA April 2017 to Present Confirm that backups have been made and successfully saved to a secureÂ  locationÂ  Planning for backup and recovery of database information.Â  Maintaining archived data Backing up and restoring databases, ContactingÂ  database vendor for technical support Generating various reports by querying from database as per needed.Â  Managing and monitoring data replication. Acting as liaison with users HighÂ  Availability or Disaster Recovery Logs - Check your high availability and/or disaster recovery process logs. Depending on the solution (Log Shipping,Â  Clustering, Replication, Database Mirroring, CDP, etc.) that you are usingÂ  dictates what needs to be checked. Correcting errors and make necessaryÂ  modificationÂ  Modify existing databases and database management systems or directÂ  programmers and analysts to make changes.Â  Work as part of a project team to coordinate database development and seeÂ  termite project scope and limitationsÂ  Train Users and answers questions.Â  Approve, schedule, plan, and supervise the installation and testing of newÂ  products and improvements to computer systems, such as the installation of new databases.Â  Review Procedures in Database management system manuals for makingÂ  changes to database.Â  Select and enter codes to monitor database performance and to createÂ  production database.Â  Check the backup failure alerts, correct the errors and rerun the backups.Â  Review the average duration of backup, any significant changes occurredÂ  investigates on this.Â  Most of the time it happens due to networking low bandwidth Validate the backup files using restore verify only.Â  I create jobs to take care of the task and to send a notification if it fails to verifyÂ  any backup.Â  Monitoring all backup and log history is cleaning when designed. Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan. I do verify the free space onÂ  each drive on all servers, If there is significant variance in free space from the day before, research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve ifÂ  necessary, Often times, log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job. The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which isÂ  having less than 15 % of free space.Â  I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values.Â  Confirm all servers/databases are up and running fine. Usually in an EnterpriseÂ  Database Environment Third Party Tools are used to monitor Servers. ForÂ  database monitoring, I can design a native SQL Server solution using T-SQLÂ  code and a maintenance plan, it run min by min and send an email to DBAÂ  team if it is not able to connect to any of the database in the instance. I do design a native scripts using T-SQL to monitor Replication, Mirroring, LogÂ  shipping.
