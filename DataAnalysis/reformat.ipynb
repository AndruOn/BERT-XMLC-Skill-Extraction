      " Database Administrator <span class=\"hl\">Database</span> <span class=\"hl\">Administrator</span> Database Administrator - Family Private Care LLC Lawrenceville, GA A self-motivated Production SQL Server Database Administrator who possesses  strong analytical and problem solving skills. My experience includes SQL Server  2005, 2008 and 2012, 2014, SSIS, as well as clustering, mirroring, and high  availability solutions in OLTP environments. I am proficient in database backup,  recovery, performance tuning, maintenance tasks, security, and consolidation.  I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company. Over the  course of my career thus far, I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs,  successfully ensured the security of those databases, problem-solved in order to meet  both back-end and front-end needs, installed and tested new versions database  management systems, customized and installed applications and meticulously  monitored performance for the smoothest front-end experience possible. During my  5 to 6 years working with databases. Work Experience Database Administrator Family Private Care LLC - Roswell, GA April 2017 to Present Confirm that backups have been made and successfully saved to a secure  location  Planning for backup and recovery of database information.  Maintaining archived data Backing up and restoring databases, Contacting  database vendor for technical support Generating various reports by querying from database as per needed.  Managing and monitoring data replication. Acting as liaison with users High  Availability or Disaster Recovery Logs - Check your high availability and/or disaster recovery process logs. Depending on the solution (Log Shipping,  Clustering, Replication, Database Mirroring, CDP, etc.) that you are using  dictates what needs to be checked. Correcting errors and make necessary  modification  Modify existing databases and database management systems or direct  programmers and analysts to make changes.  Work as part of a project team to coordinate database development and see  termite project scope and limitations  Train Users and answers questions.  Approve, schedule, plan, and supervise the installation and testing of new  products and improvements to computer systems, such as the installation of new databases.  Review Procedures in Database management system manuals for making  changes to database.  Select and enter codes to monitor database performance and to create  production database.  Check the backup failure alerts, correct the errors and rerun the backups.  Review the average duration of backup, any significant changes occurred  investigates on this.  Most of the time it happens due to networking low bandwidth Validate the backup files using restore verify only.  I create jobs to take care of the task and to send a notification if it fails to verify  any backup.  Monitoring all backup and log history is cleaning when designed. Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan. I do verify the free space on  each drive on all servers, If there is significant variance in free space from the day before, research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve if  necessary, Often times, log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job. The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which is  having less than 15 % of free space.  I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values.  Confirm all servers/databases are up and running fine. Usually in an Enterprise  Database Environment Third Party Tools are used to monitor Servers. For  database monitoring, I can design a native SQL Server solution using T-SQL  code and a maintenance plan, it run min by min and send an email to DBA  team if it is not able to connect to any of the database in the instance. I do design a native scripts using T-SQL to monitor Replication, Mirroring, Log  shipping.

      "BEFORE: Database Administrator Database Administrator Database Administrator - Family Private Care LLC Lawrenceville, GA A self-motivated Production SQL Server Database Administrator who possesses  strong analytical and problem solving skills. My experience includes SQL Server  2005, 2008 and 2012, 2014, SSIS, as well as clustering, mirroring, and high  availability solutions in OLTP environments. I am proficient in database backup,  recovery, performance tuning, maintenance tasks, security, and consolidation.  I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company. Over the  course of my career thus far, I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs,  successfully ensured the security of those databases, problem-solved in order to meet  both back-end and front-end needs, installed and tested new versions database  management systems, customized and installed applications and meticulously  monitored performance for the smoothest front-end experience possible. During my  5 to 6 years working with databases. Work Experience Database Administrator Family Private Care LLC - Roswell, GA April 2017 to Present Confirm that backups have been made and successfully saved to a secure  location  Planning for backup and recovery of database information.  Maintaining archived data Backing up and restoring databases, Contacting  database vendor for technical support Generating various reports by querying from database as per needed.  Managing and monitoring data replication. Acting as liaison with users High  Availability or Disaster Recovery Logs - Check your high availability and/or disaster recovery process logs. Depending on the solution (Log Shipping,  Clustering, Replication, Database Mirroring, CDP, etc.) that you are using  dictates what needs to be checked. Correcting errors and make necessary  modification  Modify existing databases and database management systems or direct  programmers and analysts to make changes.  Work as part of a project team to coordinate database development and see  termite project scope and limitations  Train Users and answers questions.  Approve, schedule, plan, and supervise the installation and testing of new  products and improvements to computer systems, such as the installation of new databases.  Review Procedures in Database management system manuals for making  changes to database.  Select and enter codes to monitor database performance and to create  production database.  Check the backup failure alerts, correct the errors and rerun the backups.  Review the average duration of backup, any significant changes occurred  investigates on this.  Most of the time it happens due to networking low bandwidth Validate the backup files using restore verify only.  I create jobs to take care of the task and to send a notification if it fails to verify  any backup.  Monitoring all backup and log history is cleaning when designed. Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan. I do verify the free space on  each drive on all servers, If there is significant variance in free space from the day before, research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve if  necessary, Often times, log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job. The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which is  having less than 15 % of free space.  I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values.  Confirm all servers/databases are up and running fine. Usually in an Enterprise  Database Environment Third Party Tools are used to monitor Servers. For  database monitoring, I can design a native SQL Server solution using T-SQL  code and a maintenance plan, it run min by min and send an email to DBA  team if it is not able to connect to any of the database in the instance.
