      "Innovative education initiatives also include signature programmes such as Renaissance Engineering Programme, CN Yang Scholars Programme, NTU-University Scholars Programme. Designed for high-achieving students, these programmes offer a multidisciplinary curriculum, guidance by top faculty, interdisciplinary and intensive research opportunities, overseas exposure, as well as dialogues with world-class scientists and industry leaders.?\n",
      "Set up jointly with Imperial College London, NTU's medical school, is grooming a new generation of doctors to meet the healthcare needs of Singapore.\n",
      "Research impact\n",
      "Known for research excellence and technological innovation, NTU leads the top Asian universities in normalised research citation impact (Clarivate Analyticsâ€™ InCites 2016). In the 2018Â Nature Index, NTU is placed 29th among the world's universities and first in Singapore.\n",
      "NTU's five-year strategic plan, NTU 2020, builds on strong foundations of NTU 2015 and aims to propel NTU to greater heights of research excellence. The plan focuses on five key research thrusts â€“ Sustainable Earth, Global Asia, Secure Community, Healthy Society and Future Learning. The areas leverage NTUâ€™s diverse strengths, particularly its longstanding expertise in engineering, business and education, and the interfaces these have with various disciplines such as in healthcare, science and the humanities. NTUâ€™s sustainability initiatives have clinched significant competitive research funding and the university is already a global leader in this area.\n",

My experience includes SQL ServerÂ  2005, 2008 and 2012, 2014, SSIS, as well as clustering, mirroring, and highÂ  availability solutions in OLTP environments. I am proficient in database backup,Â  recovery, performance tuning, maintenance tasks, security, and consolidation.Â  I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company. Over theÂ  course of my career thus far, I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs,Â  successfully ensured the security of those databases, problem-solved in order to meetÂ  both back-end and front-end needs, installed and tested new versions databaseÂ  management systems, customized and installed applications and meticulouslyÂ  monitored performance for the smoothest front-end experience possible.

Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan. I do verify the free space onÂ  each drive on all servers, If there is significant variance in free space from the day before, research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve ifÂ  necessary, Often times, log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job. The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which isÂ  having less than 15 % of free space.Â  I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values.Â  Confirm all servers/databases are up and running fine. Usually in an EnterpriseÂ  Database Environment Third Party Tools are used to monitor Servers. ForÂ  database monitoring, I can design a native SQL Server solution using T-SQLÂ  code and a maintenance plan, it run min by min and send an email to DBAÂ  team if it is not able to connect to any of the database in the instance. I do design a native scripts using T-SQL to monitor Replication, Mirroring, LogÂ  shipping.
